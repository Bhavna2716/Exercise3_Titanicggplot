# Exercise3_Titanicggplot
Titanic code from the ggplot part-1 exercise 

#Objective: Analyze the iconic Titanic dataset to figure out the chances of surviving the disaster. 

#Note: 
#1)Point A and B are additional codes that were not part of the datacamp Titanic exercise but they have been added 
because the original Titanic file is slightly different from the file available in datacamp exercises.

2) #Datacamp's Titanic exercise uses the term "Pclass" for passenger class while the original Titanic file has a column "class" 
so in order to run the code smoothly in R studio I have changed "Pclass" to "Class"
